# biorxiv

This tool illustrates one way a biorxiv article might indicate and link to review layers. 

The sample URL, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/540088v2, has dummy annotations in two dummy open groups I created for the demo.

The tool takes liberties with two elements on the page just for demo purposes. The disqus link becomes a summary of the # of review groups, 
annotations, and replies. The citation tools link becomes a reviews element that links to only groups that contain annotations.

It runs from a bookmarklet, which cannot be made bookmark-bar-draggable from GitHub, but there's a draggable link at
